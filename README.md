# ML.NET Samples
ML.NET is still new, and as we are developing it, we would love to get your feedback! Please fill out the brief survey below and help shape the future of ML.NET by telling us about your usage and interest in Machine Learning and ML.NET.

<a href="https://www.research.net/r/mlnet-survey">Take the survey now!</a>

At the end of the survey, you can leave your name and e-mail address (optional) so that an engineer on the .NET team can reach out to you to talk a little bit more about your experiences and thoughts. We appreciate your contribution!

[ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet) is a cross-platform open-source machine learning framework that makes machine learning accessible to .NET developers. In this GitHub repo, we provide samples which will help you get started with ML.NET and how to infuse ML into existing and new .NET apps. 

There are two types of samples/apps in the repo:

* ![](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/features/samples-new-api/images/app-type-getting-started.png)  Getting Started - ML.NET code focused samples for each ML task or area, usually implemented as simple console apps.

* ![](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/features/samples-new-api/images/app-type-e2e.png)  End-End apps - Real world examples of web, desktop, mobile, and other applications infused with Machine Learning using ML.NET

The official ML.NET samples are divided in multiple categories depending on the scenario and machine learning problem/task, accessible through the following table:

**NuGet feed configuration:** Usually you just need to use the regular NuGet feed (https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json), however, during a few days before releasing a minor release (such as 0.9, 0.10, 0.11, etc.) we'll be using Preview NuGet packages available in MyGet (such as 0.11.0-preview-27128-1), not available in the regular NuGet feed.

If that is the case, please use this MyGet feed in Visual Studio or your NuGet feed configuration:

https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json

## Additional Community Samples

In addition to the ML.NET samples provided by Microsoft, we're also highlighting samples created by the community shocased in this separated page:
[ML.NET Community Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/blob/master/docs/COMMUNITY-SAMPLES.md)

Those Community Samples are not maintained by Microsoft but by their owners.
If you have created any cool ML.NET sample, please, add its info into this [REQUEST issue](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples/issues/86) and we'll publish its information in the mentioned page, eventually.
