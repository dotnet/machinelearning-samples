A Device relative tracking origin defines a Local Origin at the position of the device in space at some previous point in time, usually at a recenter event, power-on or AR/VR session start. Pose data provided by the device will be in this space relative to the local origin. This means that poses returned in this mode will not include the user height (for VR) or the device height (for AR) and any camera tracking from the XR Device will need to be manually offset accordingly.</para>
