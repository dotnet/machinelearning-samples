This directory contains samples for ML.NET 2.0.

## Data

The samples in this directory use the following datasets:

- [Taxi Fare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisquintanilla/machinelearning-samples/main/datasets/taxi-fare-train.csv)
- [Yelp Reviews (yelp_labelled.txt)](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00331/sentiment%20labelled%20sentences.zip)
- [Home Depot](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-depot-product-search-relevance/data)

## How to use these samples

To use these samples, download the datasets above and place them in the *Data* directory.

In Visual Studio, set any of the projects as the [Startup project and run the application](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/run-program?view=vs-2022). 

**dotnet CLI**

You may have to update the `dataPath` in the console apps. Then, in the terminal, navigate to the project directory and enter `dotnet run`. 

## Samples

### AutoML

- [**AutoMLQuickStart**](AutoMLQuickStart/Program.cs) - C# console application that shows how to get started with the AutoML API.
- [**AutoMLAdvanced**](AutoMLAdvanced/Program.cs) - C# console application that shows the following concepts:
  - Modifying column inference results
  - Excluding trainers
  - Configuring monitoring
  - Choosing tuners
  - Cancelling experiments
- [**AutoMLEstimators**](AutoMLEstimators/Program.cs) - C# console application that shows how to:
  - Customize search spaces
  - Create sweepable estimators
- [**AutoMLTrialRunner**](AutoMLTrialRunner/Program.cs) - C# console application that shows how to create your own trial runner for the Text Classification API.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- [**TextClassification**](TextClassification/Program.cs) - C# console app that shows how to use the [Text Classification API](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-ml-dotnet-text-classification-api-preview/) for inferencing using code generated by Model Builder. The model is trained using [Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder).
- [**TextClassification_Sentiment_Razor**](../../../modelbuilder/TextClassification_Sentiment_Razor/README.md) - ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application for sentiment analysis. Code sample for [Analyze sentiment of website comments in a web application using ML.NET Model Builder tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-model-builder). Model is trained using Model Builder.
- [**SentenceSimilarity**](SentenceSimilarity/Program.cs) - C# console app that shows how to use the Sentence Similarity API. Like the Text Classification API, the Sentence Similarity API uses a NAS-BERT transformer-based deep learning model built with [TorchSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/torchsharp) to compare how similar two pieces of text are.
