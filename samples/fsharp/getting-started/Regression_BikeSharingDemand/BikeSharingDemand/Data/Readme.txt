Note that the Dataset files are shown in the VS Solution Explorer through "Visual Studio Links".
The actual folder holding the DatSets is placed at the same level than /src, so the datasets are separated from the source code.

This is the folder structure:

<folder-in-your-local-repo>/Data
   ---Dataset files

<folder-in-your-local-repo>/MLModels
   ---Generated trained model files

<folder-in-your-local-repo>/app-code-project
   ---Source code files
