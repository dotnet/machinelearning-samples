In this introductory sample, you'll see how to use [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet) to predict type of heart disease. In the world of machine learning, this type of prediction is known as **multiclass classification**.

##Dataset
The dataset used is this: [UCI Heart disease] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
For this dataset thanks to :
* Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D. 
* University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D. 
* University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D. 
* V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation:Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.

## Problem
This problem is centered around predicting the presence of hearth disease based on 14 attributes. To solve this problem, we will build an ML model that takes as inputs 4 parameters: 
Attribute Information:

* (age) - Age
* (sex) -  (1 = male; 0 = female) 
* (cp)  chest pain type  -- Value 1: typical angina  -- Value 2: atypical angina  -- Value 3: non-anginal pain -- Value 4: asymptomatic 
* (trestbps) - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
* (chol) - serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
* (fbs)  -  (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 
* (restecg) - esting electrocardiographic results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria 
* (thalach) - maximum heart rate achieved 
* (exang) - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 
* (oldpeak) - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
* (slope) - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment -- Value 1: upsloping -- Value 2: flat -- Value 3: downsloping  
* (ca) - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* (thal) - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect 
* (num) (the predicted attribute) diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) -- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing -- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels) 

and predicts the presence of heart disease in the patient with integer values from 0 to 4:
Experiments with the Cleveland database (dataset used for this example) have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0). 


## ML task - Multiclass classification
The generalized problem of **multiclass classification** is to classify items into one of three or more classes. (Classifying items into one of the two classes is called **binary classification**).

Some other examples of multiclass classification are:
* handwriting digit recognition: predict which of 10 digits (0-9) an image contains.
* issues labeling: predict which category (UI, back end, documentation) an issue belongs to.
* disease stage prediction based on patient's test results.

The common feature for all those examples is that the parameter we want to predict can take one of a few (more that two) values. In other words, this value is represented by `enum`, not by `integer`, `float`/`double` or `boolean` types.
